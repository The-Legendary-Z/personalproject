# Personal Project
Here is the final product of the personal project, you may view the code by clicking on `main.py`

The credentials that allow the connection to my account have been removed, so it is *not* possible to run the program without the credentials.

I have included extensive comments that outline the use of the important lines of code.

The license you might see is there in case i decide to use or share this project myself.
